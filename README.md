## Viewing STEP Files

The CAD drawings in this repository are saved in the STEP file format, which is an ISO standard for the exchange of product model data. This format is supported by many CAD programs across various platforms.

To view STEP files, you will need CAD software that supports the STEP format (ISO 10303). Here are some options you may consider:

- **FreeCAD**: An open-source parametric 3D CAD modeler that can open STEP files. FreeCAD is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. [Download FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/)
- **Autodesk Fusion 360**: A powerful, commercial-grade CAD software that offers STEP file compatibility. Fusion 360 has a free tier for hobbyists and startups. [Learn more about Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview)
- **Onshape**: A cloud-based CAD platform that allows you to import and work with STEP files directly in your web browser. [Sign up for Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/)
- **SOLIDWORKS**: A widely-used, professional CAD software that provides robust tools for viewing and editing STEP files. [Discover SOLIDWORKS](https://www.solidworks.com/)
